**Thank you for taking the time to get to know me, here are a few more facts about me...**

I value learning above all and stay curious about everything I work on. I strive for mastery in every role I take on, aim for best-in-class results, and learn from failures. I'm passionate about applying cutting-edge technologies to motorsport, aerospace, and everyday life.

**Hobbies:**
- Motorsport and cars enthusiast! 🏎️
- Huge Lego fan and collector 🧱
- Martial artist for over 12 years 🥋
- I love turtles 🐢

Currently I have been developing my latest skills as a Design Engineer for the most advanced agricultural electrification projects at John Deere.  
I'm excited to see where the next project takes me.
